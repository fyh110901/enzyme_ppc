Hydrolysis catalyzed by aspartic proteases is a crucial reaction in many biological processes.  Using our self-developed polarizable point charge (PPC) force field, we determined the significant role of polarization in hydrolases for the first time. For water to be stably anchored in the active site, it must be intensely polarized with a charge higher than -0.94e. Induced by this polarization, pepsin, a typical aspartic pro-tease, was shown to support three general base/general acid pathways, with a preference for the gemdiol-intermediate-based pathway. Consequently, we proposed the "Blade of Polarized Water Molecule" model for rational enzyme design, highlighting that the polarization of both the attacking water and the attacked carbonyl is crucial for enhancing hydrolysis.
